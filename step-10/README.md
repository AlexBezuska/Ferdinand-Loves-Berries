#Step 10 - Let the player eat berries!

- Loop over all berries each frame
- check if player is colliding with any of the berries in the array
- if player is touching a berry, splice(remove) it from the array

####JavaScript loop

- Run the same code for every berry
- Runs once per frame
- 'i' is the current berry ex. this.food[10]


####JavaScript Array Splice Explanation

- splice means remove from an array
- example: this.food.splice(i,1);
- the 'i' is which one you want to remove
- the '1' is how many to remove
