# Intro to game programming pt 2

In the first installment of this class we learned several of the basic building blocks of game programming, and programming in general.
In this class we will expand on the game we started, adding our own custom sound effects, sprite characters, and background.
We will use free all and open source tools making it easy to continue working on our games at home. Bring your imaginition!
